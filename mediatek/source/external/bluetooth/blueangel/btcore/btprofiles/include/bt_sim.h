 *         connection is established, the SAEVENT_SERVER_OPEN event will be

 *         must respond to this by sending the current card status by calling

 *
 *         If the Status is set to SIM_CONN_STATUS_UNABLE, the connection is

 *
 * Returns:

 *         will receive a SAEVENT_SERVER_OPEN when the accept message has been 
 *         sent and the channel is open.
