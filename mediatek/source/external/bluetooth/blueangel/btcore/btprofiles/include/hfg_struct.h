 * Hands-Free Audio Gateway SDK layer
 *
 * This API allows an application to act as the "Hands-Free Audio Gateway"
 * (AG) role of the Hands-Free Profile. Devices in this role are responsible
 * for providing an interface to a telephone network (such as GSM) under
 * the direct control of a "Hands-Free Unit". For example, the AG may be
 * a mobile phone interacting with a hands-free unit installed in a car.
 *
 * Within this API, there are two "levels" of links: service and
 * audio, each with their own function calls and events. A service-level
 * connection allows the hands-free unit to send commands to the AG, such as 
 * HFG_SendRing().  An audio-level link allows full-duplex sound to be exchanged 
 * between the hands-free unit and the AG. Using this API, the service link must
 * be established BEFORE attempting to open an audio link.
