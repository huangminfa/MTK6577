/** \defgroup glossary_Appearance Appearance
    \ingroup glossary

The word 'appearance' is used within A3M to describe all the visual properties
of the object to be rendered.  In 3DSMax and Ngin3D this is known as 'material'
i.e. the two terms are equivalent. All external references to this set of
properties should be called 'material' although some remnant of the 'appearance'
naming exist and are supported, such as the .ap file extension.
