 * Phonebook Access Profile Object Store (PBAPOBS) Layer
 *
 *     These functions are used internally by PBAP to handle the OBEX object
 *     store requirements.  However, PBAP does receive information in
 *     response to the object store function calls.  Specifically, 
 *     PBAPOBS_Read, PBAPOBS_ReadFlex, and PBAPOPBS_Write will cause the 
 *     PBAP_EVENT_DATA_REQ and PBAP_EVENT_DATA_IND events to occur.  These
 *     events allow the PBAP application to deal with data requests and 
 *     data indications as they occur. More information on these events is
 *     available in pbap.h.
