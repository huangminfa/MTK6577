 * General: Sends a message for this call object.

 *
 *          Note that according to 3GPP documentation, the stream that is

 *          oriented. The LSB is always transmitted first. This means that when
 *          a call is made between 3G terminal and ISDN terminal, it is the
 *          responsibility of the application of the ISDN terminal to make sure
 *          that the ISDN protocol stack converts the byte stream to a bit stream
 *          correctly.
