 Instructions for use of SRS encoding/decoding:

 General:
		SRS is a systematic block-encoding scheme. 
		"Systematic" means that the parity is appended to the block, leaving the data 
		unchanged. This implies, for example, that the AL-SDU* header can be read without
      SRS decoding.
		The H223 protocol specifies symbol size of 8 bits, which translates to blocks of 
		255 bytes or less. The symbol size also implies encoding of whole bytes only.

 E_target:
      H223 specified (in D.4.1.7.3) that the SRS code shall encode using a parameter
      called e_target which is part of the transmission configuration. This parameter,
		which ranges from 1 to just under 128, determines THE NUMBER OF PARITY BYTES in
		each 255 byte block. E_target is called SRS_PARITY_SIZE in the implementation below.
		Example:
		    If E_target === SRS_PARITY_SIZE == 32, each block will contain up to 223 data
			bytes and exactly 32 parity bytes.
		The higher the E_target value, the more parity bytes there are and the better the
      error-correction ability. The down side is in bandwidth (obvious) and in the CPU
		time which will be required to correct errors (which may be significant - see below).
      
 How to encode:
      1. Decide on the E_target (SRS_PARITY_SIZE) parameter size.
      2. Compute data_block_size = 255-SRS_PARITY_SIZE
		3. For each data_block_size data bytes
		4.		Copy them to the AL-PDU buffer (possibly transmitting them)
		5.		Call SRS_encode_parity, with the "parity" param pointing either
				directly into the AL-PDU buffer or a side-buffer of size SRS_PARITY_SIZE

 How to decode: Same idea, in blocks of 255 bytes (or less) of the AL-PDU.
		Note the unlike the encoding which does not change the source buffer, the decoder
		will need to change the source if there are errors.

 CPU / memory requirements:
		Memory requirement: 65.5K of pre-defined static tables, plus under 6K stack
      CPU: Encoding is quick: data_block_size*SRS_PARITY_SIZE table lookups and XORs
           Decoding is similar, as long as there are no errors.
           If there are errors, the complexity of error correction is dependent
           on the e_target parameter. It's both O(e_target^3) and O(e_target^2 * data_block_size)
           SRS provides very strong error-correction but with CPU requirements which are
			 somewhat higher than other algorithms.
