/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * btmtk_chn_register()
 *
 *     Registers and initializes a channel for use in creating and receiving
 *     service level connections.  Registers the Hands-Free profile audio
 *     gateway with SDP.  The application callback function is also bound
 *     to the channel.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     Channel - Contains a pointer to the channel structure that will be
 *         initialized and registered.
 *
 *     Callback - The application callback function that will receive events.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_SUCCESS - The operation completed successfully.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_IN_USE - The operation failed because the channel has already
 *         been initialized. 
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_FAILED - The operation failed because either the RFCOMM
 *         channel or the SDP record could not be registered.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_INVALID_PARM - A parameter is invalid or not properly 
 *         initialized (XA_ERROR_CHECK only).
 */

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * btmtk_chn_deregister()
 *
 *     Deregisters the channel.  The channel becomes unbound from RFCOMM and
 *     SDP, and can no longer be used for creating service level connections.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     Channel - Contains a pointer to the channel structure that will be
 *         deregistered.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_SUCCESS - The operation completed successfully.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_NOT_FOUND - The specifiec channel has not been registered.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_BUSY - The operation failed because a service level connection 
 *         is still open to the audio gateway.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_INVALID_PARM - A parameter is invalid or not properly 
 *         initialized (XA_ERROR_CHECK only).

BtStatus btmtk_chn_deregister(ChnChannelContext *Channel);

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * btmtk_chn_create_service_link()
 *
 *     Creates a service level connection with the hands-free unit.
 *     This includes performing SDP Queries to find the appropriate service
 *     and opening an RFCOMM channel.  The success of the operation is indicated 
 *     by the HFG_EVENT_SERVICE_CONNECTED event.  If the connection fails, the
 *     application is notified by the HFG_EVENT_SERVICE_DISCONNECTED event. 
 * 
 *     If an ACL link does not exist to the audio gateway, one will be 
 *     created first.  If desired, however, the ACL link can be established 
 *     prior to calling this function.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *     Channel - Pointer to a registered channel structure.
 *
 *     Addr - The Bluetooth address of the remote device.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_PENDING - The operation has started, the application will be 
 *         notified when the connection has been created (via the callback 
 *         function registered by btmtk_hfgRegister).
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_NOT_FOUND - The specifiec channel has not been registered.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_BUSY - The operation failed because a connection is already
 *         open to the remote device, or a new connection is being created.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_FAILED - The channel has not been registered.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_CONNECTION_FAILED - The connection failed.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_INVALID_PARM - A parameter is invalid or not properly 
 *         initialized (XA_ERROR_CHECK only).

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * btmtk_chn_disconnect_service_link()
 *
 *     Releases the service level connection with the hands-free unit. This will 
 *     close the RFCOMM channel and will also close the SCO and ACL links if no 
 *     other services are active, and no other link handlers are in use 
 *     (ME_CreateLink).  When the operation is complete the application will be 
 *     notified by the HFG_EVENT_SERVICE_DISCONNECTED event.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     Channel - Pointer to a registered channel structure.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_PENDING - The operation has started, the application will be 
 *         notified when the service level connection is down (via the callback 
 *         function registered by btmtk_chn_register).
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_NOT_FOUND - The specifiec channel has not been registered.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_NO_CONNECTION - The operation failed because a service link
 *         does not exist to the audio gateway.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_INVALID_PARM - A parameter is invalid or not properly 
 *         initialized (XA_ERROR_CHECK only).

 * btmtk_chn_create_audio_link()
 *
 *     Creates an audio (SCO) link to the hands-free unit. The success of the

 *     connection fails, the application is notified by the

 * Parameters:

 *
 * Returns:
