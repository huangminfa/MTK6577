/** \defgroup a3mCpp  A3M, a C++/Native Users Guide.

What a user needs to know to write a 3D graphics application in
C++ using the A3M rendering and facility APIs on Android, Linux or Windows.

*/


/** \defgroup a3mCusr A C++ Users Guide
    \ingroup a3mCpp

A3M (Advanced 3D Middleware) Native C++ Users Guide.

Here a [new] user is guided through the process of using A3M at the C++
API.  This is \b not for Android users unless, exceptionally, they are
writing native applications.

New users should read the \ref a3mPrimer. Even if you are familiar with graphics
programming it is probably worth reading the \ref a3mPrimer to align yourself to
A3M's use of graphics terminology.


\todo A walkthrough of using all the C++ API.

These are classes and other items that have been implemented but \b not fully
integrated with the public API. They are used internally and have become public
by accident rather than design. They are not fully documented or defined. Use
these with extreme care, and do not expect them to be supported in exactly this
form in the future.

\warning These facilities may change, or disappear, without warning.
